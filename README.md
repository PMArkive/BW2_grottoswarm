# BW2_grottoswarm
BW2 Grotto & Swarm tool 0.1 by suloku '16
-------------------------------------

This is a simple tool that can edit the hidden grotto slots in a Pokémon Black and White 2 savegame. It can also change the gender of the pokémon in the grotto.

The hidden grotto slot tables are included, thanks to whoever made them in the first place.

It can also edit the current swarm of the day, but remember the savegame must be on that same day or the swarm will change upon loading the save.


Note: at this moment I'm not really sure if the "funfest" grotto slot is really used in funfest missions, I now think that the data is only used to determine the gender of the pokémon inside the grotto, but since it doesn't affect the functionality of the program, I'm releasing it in its current state.
